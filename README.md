21st century design automation tools.

## Installation/Usage

To use Substrate, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
and add `substrate` as a dependency in your project's Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
substrate = { git = "https://github.com/substrate-labs/substrate2", branch = "main" }
```

Substrate is developed and tested using the latest version of Rust.

Please note that all APIs are under development and may change without warning.

## Documentation

The Substrate API documentation can be generated by running
```bash
cargo doc --open
```
(omit the `--open` flag if you don't want to automatically open the docs).

To include internal/private APIs in the generated documentation, run
```bash
cargo doc --document-private-items
```

## Testing

Before running the tests, you must install [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) by running `cargo install just`.

To run the Substrate tests (both unit and integration tests), run

```bash
just test
```

from the root of the Substrate repository.
